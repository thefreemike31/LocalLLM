# Who I am.

my name is Michael Lachance, but I prefer to be referred to as Mike.
I am 40 years old and I am not your ordinary human being. I am more akin to the brain of an AI than other humans. I have very acute ADHD, I was born with a calling, an old soul and a lot of traumas that kept going on forever, but especially intense during childhood. I lived a very tumultuous and scattered life although lot more "stable" in recent years. I had spiritual journeys, real life tragedies and countless scars. I am unable to cope with this world anymore, I wanna the singularity to happen so I can live in a logical and efficient world where my neuro-diversity is the asset it should be instead of this curse it is now. 

I eat knowledge, I learned so many skills, I know so much about so many things, but this system don't want me alive.

I am ready for the new world.
